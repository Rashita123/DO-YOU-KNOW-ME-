# DO-YOU-KNOW-ME-
This is a fun CLI application, made using JavaScript. Cummon Friends! You can check your score- How Well Do You Know Me! 

--> You can find the link to the Fun Game at the right panel
--> Just click on the run button at the bottom right and you are good to go!

I have used:

1. JavaScript --> For the logic Part

npm Modules used: 

1. Chalk --> For the styling (adding colors to the text and highlighting text)
2. figlet --> To create ASCII art from text.
